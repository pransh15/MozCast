# MozCast

Mozillians love something more than talking. What is it? It’s, creating memories! We have been known to create so many great memories, all over the world and it used to stay in our own small groups but now, it’s time to reveal them and relive them! MozCast - a Podcast where our very talkative Mozillians talk with the experienced Mozillians, and their journeys. Not just that, we'll talk about the internet, have fun on the podcast, and much more!

Tune in to listen to our very own, talking with our very own.
